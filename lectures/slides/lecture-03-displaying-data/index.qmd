## Exploratory vs. Explanatory Plots

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Exploratory]{.keyword}

-   Purpose: *find* the story in the data
-   Audience: you (the analyst)
-   Minimal concern for aesthetics
    -   Rough labels
    -   Default colors
    -   Rapid iteration
-   Focused on understanding patterns and relationships
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Explanatory]{.keyword}

-   Purpose: *share* the story of the data
-   Audience: others
-   Careful design choices
    -   Clear labels and scales
    -   Thoughtful color use
    -   Accessible in grayscale
-   Assumes the audience may be unfamiliar with the data
:::
:::::

::: notes
Most real plots fall on a continuum between these extremes—\
from what you make for yourself to what you present to a broad public audience.

## Data Visualization Example: Anscombe’s Quartet

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Four data sets with identical summary statistics.
-   Same means, standard deviations, and correlations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
| Dataset | $\\bar{x}$ | $\\bar{y}$ | $s_x$ | $s_y$ | $r_{x,y}$ |
|--------:|-----------:|-----------:|------:|------:|----------:|
|       I |        9.0 |        7.5 | 3.316 | 2.031 |     0.816 |
|      II |        9.0 |        7.5 | 3.316 | 2.031 |     0.816 |
|     III |        9.0 |        7.5 | 3.316 | 2.031 |     0.816 |
|      IV |        9.0 |        7.5 | 3.316 | 2.031 |     0.816 |

## What Makes a Plot Effective (or Misleading)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Good plots**

-   Show the data, not just summaries
-   Make patterns easy to see
-   Represent magnitudes accurately
-   Use clear, readable graphics
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Bad plots**

-   Hide or obscure the data
-   Make patterns difficult to detect
-   Distort magnitudes
-   Use cluttered or unclear graphics
:::
:::::

## Show the data, not just the summaries

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/clipboard-199959289.png)

-   Shows means only

-   Variation within positions is hidden
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/clipboard-974688347.png)

-   Shows individuals

-   Points are overplotted

-   Obscures density of points
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/slide-14-01.png)

-   Shows all of the observations.
-   [Jittering]{.keyword} - shifting points horizontally (random)

## Make Patterns Easy to See

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### How patterns get hidden

-   Rely on a single plot
-   Use inappropriate or misleading scales
-   Arrange groups arbitrarily
-   Ignore meaningful ordering
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### How patterns are revealed

-   Explore multiple plot types
-   Choose scales that match the data
-   Arrange factors intentionally
-   Order groups:
    -   By level for ordinal variables
    -   By mean (or another summary) for nominal variables
:::
:::::

## Nonsensical Order Hides Patterns

Non-intuitive ordering of factors hides patterns. ![](images/slide-16-01.png)

## Inappropriate scales hides patterns

![](images/slide-17-01.png)

## Transform Data to Reveal Patterns

In this plot, a log-log scale reveals a pattern hidden on the linear scale. Lifespan by body size in mammals, data from Allison & Cicchetti 1976 ![](images/slide-18-01.png)

## Mistake 3: Display Magnitudes Dishonestly

How to represent magnitudes dishonestly: - Start bar plots at a non-zero value How to represent magnitudes honestly: - Sat bar plots at zero **Why? The weight of a bar plot** **makes us think in magnitudes.**

## Present Magnitudes Dishonestly (1 of 2)

This plot suggests that centers are 20X taller than guards. ![](images/slide-20-01.png)

## Present Magnitudes Dishonestly (2 of 2)

Note: This applies to bar plots that naturally start at zero. Not all plots need to start at zero. ![](images/slide-21-01.png)

## Mistake 4: Draw Elements Unclearly

How to draw graphical elements unclearly:

-   Unthinkingly accept default options from plotting programs.
-   Do not consider how a diverse audience will interpret your figure.

How to draw graphical elements clearly:

-   Reflect on plot design.
-   Consider the diverse audience you are reaching and how they may interact with your plot.

## Draw Graphics Unclearly

In this plot, x-axis labels obscure one another.

## Flip Axes to Present Graphics Clearly

Flipping axes makes categories readable.

## Clear Graphics for Everyone

ALWAYS Consider colorblind readers

## Direct Labeling Clarifies Graphics

Labels directly on plots (left hand side) quickly clarifies patterns.

## Let data type guide presentation

## Consider Data Type

In presentation, “form follows data structure” One categorical variable: - Bar plots and Tables. One numerical variable: - Histograms, Density plots, and Cumulative Freq. Distros. Two categorical variables: - Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots. One numerical variable + one categorical variable: - Multiple histograms, Strip charts, and Box plots. Two numerical variables and beyond: - Scatterplots and Small multiples

## One Categorical Variable: Bar plots and Tables

One Categorical Variable: Bar plots and Tables

## Nonsensical ordering hides patterns

Order ordinal factors meaningfully. - For example, January to December. Order nominal factors by count. - If there is a grab bag category, place it after the lowest count. Example: Leading Causes of Death

## Ordering Factors Nonsensically

Before re-ordering factors, patterns are unclear.

## Ordering Factors Meaningfully

After re-ordering factors, patterns become clear.

## Tables Should Follow Similar Rules (1 of 2)

Nonsense order hides patterns Alphabetical order is usually a bad idea.

## Tables Should Follow Similar Rules (2 of 2)

Order to reveal patterns List ordinal factors in a meaningful order. List nominal factors from greatest to least, with “all others” last.

## One Numerical Variable: Histograms, Density plots, and Cumulative Freq. Distros

One Numerical Variable: Histograms, Density plots, and Cumulative Freq. Distros

## One Numerical Variable—Goals

Visualize the center (Mean) Visualize the width (Variation) Visualize the shape (Distribution)

## Example: Gettysburg Address

All of the words in the Gettysburg Address. Let’s see the number of times words of various lengths come up.

## Gettysburg Address: Summary Table

Number of words of a given length in the Gettysburg Address.

## Histograms visually describe summary tables

## Histograms—Consider Your Bins

Each block of a histogram is called a bin The size or “width” of a bin refers to the range in each block. Changing bins can change stories. - Don’t be fooled. - Don’t allow bad bin widths to obscure your data. DO NOT assume that default bin widths are appropriate.

## Density plots serve a similar purpose as histograms, but smooth the distribution.

Like histograms (even more so), we can be fooled by bandwidth, take control of this

## Cumulative Frequency Distributions clearly communicate quantiles

## Shapes of Distributions

Histograms, density plots, and cumulative frequency plots can reveal the shapes of distributions. This is important for understanding data and choosing a statistical approach.

## Distribution Shapes: Histograms

Bell-shaped Bimodal Skewed Uniform

## Distribution Shapes: Density plots

Bell-shaped Bimodal Skewed Uniform ![](images/slide-45-01.png)

## Distribution Shapes: Cumul. Freq. Distros.

Bell-shaped Bimodal Skewed Uniform ![](images/slide-46-01.png)

## Two Categorical Variables: Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots

Two Categorical Variables: Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots

## Two Categorical Variables—Goals

Visualize the association between variables. Example: Is Breeding Dangerous for Birds

## Is Breeding Dangerous for Birds?

Oppliger et al. (1996) removed eggs from some, but not other, *Parus* *major* nests to encourage them to breed more. They later assayed the moms for malaria. Here are the data as a **contingency table**.

## Visualization: Grouped Bar Graph

## Visualization: Stacked Bar Graph

## Visualization: Mosaic Plot

## One categorical and one numerical variable: Multiple histograms and Strip charts

## Example: Edgar Anderson’s Iris Data Set

Multiple Histograms This dataset is in R stats package print(iris)

## Avoid Over-plotting

Over-plotting hides data by placing data points on top of each other.

## Good Alternative: Strip Chart

To show data, data points are jittered about the x-axis. Note: The position on the x within groups is not meaningful.

## Another Alternative: Violin Plot

The shape of the “violins” reflects the distribution of the data.

## Quiz 1 results

## Two numerical variables: Scatterplots

## Two Numerical Variables—Goals

Visualize the association. Visualize the joint distribution.

## Two Continuous: Scatterplots

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Scatterplot With Legend

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Scatterplot Directly Label

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Small Multiples

## Line Graphs Show Data Over Time

For temporal data, note all observations with a data point, and connect each point with a line. Points may be omitted for clarity if there are no gaps

## Color Code Maps to Show Spatial Data

Note: Maps need not refer to areas of land. For example, you can make a map of gene expression across the body.

## Best Practices for Saving and Sharing Data:

Guidelines for Making Data Easy to Analyze - Each row should correspond to one observation, and each column should correspond to a variable. - Avoid special characters such as \$ \# ! %. - Ensure column names are easily interpretable. - Save spreadsheets as a plain text file (.csv or .txt). - Make sure the data are correct. - Include a data dictionary with fuller explanations. Statistics is much easier if data are well formatted.
