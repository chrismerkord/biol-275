## Key Learning Objectives

-   Distinguish between explanatory and exploratory figures
-   Identify what makes a good graph
-   Understand how data types drive figure design
-   Understand how to make effective tables
-   Identify best practices in figure design

## Displaying data helps you **understand** your data and **communicate** your results

## Exploratory vs. Explanatory Plots

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Exploratory]{.keyword}

-   Purpose: *find* the story in the data
-   Audience: you (the analyst)
-   Minimal concern for aesthetics
    -   Rough labels
    -   Default colors
    -   Rapid iteration
-   Focused on understanding patterns and relationships
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Explanatory]{.keyword}

-   Purpose: *share* the story of the data
-   Audience: others
-   Careful design choices
    -   Clear labels and scales
    -   Thoughtful color use
    -   Accessible in grayscale
-   Assumes the audience may be unfamiliar with the data
:::
:::::

::: notes
Most real plots fall on a continuum between these extremes—\
from what you make for yourself to what you present to a broad public audience.

## Data Visualization Example: Anscombe’s Quartet

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Four data sets with identical summary statistics.
-   Same means, standard deviations, and correlations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
| Dataset | $\\bar{x}$ | $\\bar{y}$ | $s_x$ | $s_y$ | $r_{x,y}$ |
|--------:|-----------:|-----------:|------:|------:|----------:|
|       I |        9.0 |        7.5 | 3.316 | 2.031 |     0.816 |
|      II |        9.0 |        7.5 | 3.316 | 2.031 |     0.816 |
|     III |        9.0 |        7.5 | 3.316 | 2.031 |     0.816 |
|      IV |        9.0 |        7.5 | 3.316 | 2.031 |     0.816 |

## Trendlines for Anscombe's quartet show exactly the same pattern

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   A fitted trendline looks essentially identical across datasets

## Visualizing the Data Reveals What Statistics Miss

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   The underlying data distributions are very different
-   Patterns include nonlinearity, outliers, and leverage points
-   Graphs expose structure that summary statistics conceal

## What Makes a Plot Effective (or Misleading)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Good plots**

-   Show the data, not just summaries
-   Make patterns easy to see
-   Represent magnitudes accurately
-   Use clear, readable graphics
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Bad plots**

-   Hide or obscure the data
-   Make patterns difficult to detect
-   Distort magnitudes
-   Use cluttered or unclear graphics
:::
:::::

## Show the data, not just the summaries

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/clipboard-199959289.png)

-   Shows means only

-   Variation within positions is hidden
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/clipboard-974688347.png)

-   Shows individuals

-   Points are overplotted

-   Obscures density of points
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
![](images/slide-14-01.png)

-   Shows all of the observations.
-   [Jittering]{.keyword} - shifting points horizontally (random)

## Make Patterns Easy to See

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### How patterns get hidden

-   Rely on a single plot
-   Use inappropriate or misleading scales
-   Arrange groups arbitrarily
-   Ignore meaningful ordering
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### How patterns are revealed

-   Explore multiple plot types
-   Choose scales that match the data
-   Arrange factors intentionally
-   Order groups:
    -   By level for ordinal variables
    -   By mean (or another summary) for nominal variables
:::
:::::

## Nonsensical Order Hides Patterns

Non-intuitive ordering of factors hides patterns. ![](images/slide-16-01.png)

## Inappropriate scales hides patterns

## Transform Data to Reveal Patterns

In this plot, a log-log scale reveals a pattern hidden on the linear scale. Lifespan by body size in mammals, data from Allison & Cicchetti 1976 ![](images/slide-18-01.png)

## Mistake: Display Magnitudes Dishonestly

How to represent magnitudes dishonestly:

-   Start bar plots at a non-zero value

How to represent magnitudes honestly:

-   Start bar plots at zero **Why? The weight of a bar plot** **makes us think in magnitudes.**

## Present Magnitudes Dishonestly (1 of 2)

This plot suggests that centers are 20X taller than guards. ![](images/slide-20-01.png)

## Present Magnitudes Dishonestly (2 of 2)

Note: This applies to bar plots that naturally start at zero. Not all plots need to start at zero. ![](images/slide-21-01.png)

## Mistake: Draw Elements Unclearly

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
How to draw graphical elements *unclearly*:

-   Unthinkingly accept default options from plotting programs.
-   Do not consider how a diverse audience will interpret your figure.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
How to draw graphical elements *clearly*:

-   Reflect on plot design.

-   Consider the diverse audience you are reaching and how they may interact with your plot.
:::

## Draw Graphics Unclearly

In this plot, x-axis labels obscure one another.

## Flip Axes to Present Graphics Clearly

Flipping axes makes categories readable.

## Always consider color-blind readers
