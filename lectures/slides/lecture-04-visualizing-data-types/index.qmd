## Why Graphs Matter

Graphs help us see patterns that are hard to detect in raw numbers.

They allow us to:

-   Summarize large amounts of data
-   Compare groups or values quickly
-   See trends, differences, and relationships

But different graphs highlight different things.\
Choosing the right graph is necessary to show the most important features of the data clearly.

## In data visualization, form follows data structure

The type of graph you choose should be determined by:

-   How many variables you have
-   Whether each variable is **categorical** or **numerical**
-   What relationship or pattern you want to reveal

## Distributions: Looking at One Variable

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A [distribution]{.keyword} describes how the values of a single variable are spread out

When you make a **histogram** or **bar chart**, you are showing:

-   What values occur
-   How often each value occurs
-   Where values are common or rare
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Visualizing distributions helps you:

-   Understand typical values
-   See variability and spread
-   Detect skew, gaps, or unusual values

When you graph **one variable**, you are almost always graphing its distribution.

## One Categorical Variable: [Barcharts]{.keyword}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Goal:** Show how *observations* are distributed across *categories*

-   Each column represents a category
-   Height = frequency (number of observations)
-   Bars are separated (categories are distinct)
-   Bar height encodes frequency or proportion
-   Best practice: **order by frequency**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: barchart-penguins
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-cap: "Barchart showing how penguins observations are distributed among three species in the Palmer Penguins dataset (Horst et al. 2020)"

library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
library(palmerpenguins, quietly = TRUE)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = fct_infreq(species), fill = species)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"), 
                    guide = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  labs(
    x = "Species",
    y = "Number of penguins",
    title = "Distribution of penguins by species"
  )
```

## Tables can be used if necessary

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: penguins-table-code
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(gt)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |> 
  count(species) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    species = "Species",
    n = "Number of penguins"
  )
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: penguins-table-graph
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

library(gt)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |> 
  count(species) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>

  cols_label(
    species = "Species",
    n = "Number of penguins"
  ) |> 
  tab_options(
    table.font.size = px(24)
  )
```

## Order factors meaningfully

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Ordinal variables:

-   use pre-defined order (e.g. months Jan-Dec)

Nominal variables:

-   Most interested in the largest categories

-   Order by frequency

-   Place catch-all category at the bottom

-   Swap axes to give category labels more room

Example: Leading Causes of Death

## Visualizing One Numerical Variable

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Goal:** Understand the *distribution* of values in a single numerical variable.

These graphs are used to show:

-   Where values are *concentrated* (center, location)
-   How *spread out* the data are (width, variation)
-   Whether the distribution is *symmetric* or *skewed*
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Common graph types:

-   Histograms
-   Density plots
-   Cumulative frequency distributions

When you graph one numerical variable, you are visualizing its *distribution*.

## Example: Gettysburg Address

::::: columns

|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Word length** | **Number of words** |
| 1               | 7                   |

| 3               | 60                  |
| 4               | 58                  |
| 5               | 34                  |
| 6               | 24                  |
| 7               | 15                  |
| 8               | 6                   |
| 9               | 10                  |
| 10              | 4                   |
| 11              | 3                   |

## [Histograms]{.keyword} display the distribution of a *numerical* variable

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Values grouped into intervals called [bins]{.keyword}

-   Height = number of observations (frequency)

-   Show distribution shape

-   Show skewness or symmetry

-   Show gaps or unusual values

-   Bars touch

## Choosing Bin Widths

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Bin width defines how numerical values are grouped
-   Different bin widths can reveal or obscure patterns
-   Bin widths should be chosen deliberately
-   Default settings are rarely optimal
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: histogram-narrow-bins
#| fig-height: 2.8
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-cap: "A histogram with bins that are too narrow."


penguins |> 
  filter(!is.na(bill_length_mm)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=100, fill = "darkcyan") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

```{r}
#| label: histogram-wide-bins
#| fig-height: 2.8
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-cap: "A histogram with bins that are too wide"


penguins |> 
  filter(!is.na(bill_length_mm)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=4, fill = "darkcyan") +

## Density plots serve a similar purpose as histograms, but smooth the distribution.

Like histograms (even more so), we can be fooled by bandwidth, take control of this

## Cumulative Frequency Distributions clearly communicate quantiles

## Shapes of Distributions

Histograms, density plots, and cumulative frequency plots can reveal the shapes of distributions. This is important for understanding data and choosing a statistical approach.

## Two Categorical Variables: Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots

Two Categorical Variables: Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots

## Two Categorical Variables—Goals

Visualize the association between variables. Example: Is Breeding Dangerous for Birds

## Is Breeding Dangerous for Birds?

Oppliger et al. (1996) removed eggs from some, but not other, *Parus* *major* nests to encourage them to breed more. They later assayed the moms for malaria. Here are the data as a **contingency table**.

## Visualization: Grouped Bar Graph

## Visualization: Stacked Bar Graph

## Visualization: Mosaic Plot

## One categorical and one numerical variable: Multiple histograms and Strip charts

## Example: Edgar Anderson’s Iris Data Set

Multiple Histograms This dataset is in R stats package print(iris)

## Avoid Over-plotting

Over-plotting hides data by placing data points on top of each other.

## Good Alternative: Strip Chart

To show data, data points are jittered about the x-axis. Note: The position on the x within groups is not meaningful.

## Another Alternative: Violin Plot

The shape of the “violins” reflects the distribution of the data.

## Two numerical variables: Scatterplots

## Two Numerical Variables—Goals

Visualize the association. Visualize the joint distribution.

## Two Continuous: Scatterplots

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Scatterplot With Legend

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Scatterplot Directly Label

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Small Multiples

## Line Graphs Show Data Over Time

For temporal data, note all observations with a data point, and connect each point with a line. Points may be omitted for clarity if there are no gaps

## Color Code Maps to Show Spatial Data

Note: Maps need not refer to areas of land. For example, you can make a map of gene expression across the body.
