## Why Graphs Matter

Graphs help us see patterns that are hard to detect in raw numbers.

They allow us to:

-   Summarize large amounts of data
-   Compare groups or values quickly
-   See trends, differences, and relationships

But different graphs highlight different things.\
Choosing the right graph is necessary to show the most important features of the data clearly.

## In data visualization, form follows data structure

The type of graph you choose should be determined by:

-   How many variables you have
-   Whether each variable is **categorical** or **numerical**
-   What relationship or pattern you want to reveal

## Distributions: Looking at One Variable

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
A [distribution]{.keyword} describes how the values of a single variable are spread out

When you make a **histogram** or **bar chart**, you are showing:

-   What values occur
-   How often each value occurs
-   Where values are common or rare
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Visualizing distributions helps you:

-   Understand typical values
-   See variability and spread
-   Detect skew, gaps, or unusual values

When you graph **one variable**, you are almost always graphing its distribution.

## One Categorical Variable: Bar plots and Tables

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Goal:** Show how *observations* are distributed across *categories*

-   Each bar represents a category
-   Height = frequency (number of observations)
-   Bars are separated (categories are distinct)
-   Bar height encodes frequency or proportion
-   Best practice: **order by frequency**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: barchart-penguins
#| fig-height: 4
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-cap: "Barchart showing how penguins observations are distributed among three species in the Palmer Penguins dataset (Horst et al. 2020)"

library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
library(palmerpenguins, quietly = TRUE)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = fct_infreq(species), fill = species)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4"), 
                    guide = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  labs(
    x = "Species",
    y = "Number of penguins",
    title = "Number of penguins by species"
  )
```

## Tables can be used if necessary

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: penguins-table-code
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(gt)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |> 
  count(species) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    species = "Species",
    n = "Number of penguins"
  )
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| label: penguins-table-graph
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

library(gt)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

penguins |> 
  count(species) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  cols_label(
    species = "Species",
    n = "Number of penguins"
  ) |> 
  tab_options(
    table.font.size = px(24)
  )
```
:::
:::::

## Order factors meaningfully

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Ordinal variables:

-   use pre-defined order (e.g. months Jan-Dec)

Nominal variables:

-   Most interested in the largest categories

-   Order by frequency

-   Place catch-all category at the bottom

-   Swap axes to give category labels more room

## One Numerical Variable: Histograms, Density plots, and Cumulative Freq. Distros

One Numerical Variable: Histograms, Density plots, and Cumulative Freq. Distros

## One Numerical Variable—Goals

Visualize the center (Mean) Visualize the width (Variation) Visualize the shape (Distribution)

## Example: Gettysburg Address

All of the words in the Gettysburg Address. Let’s see the number of times words of various lengths come up.

## Gettysburg Address: Summary Table

Number of words of a given length in the Gettysburg Address.

## Histograms visually describe summary tables

## Histograms—Consider Your Bins

Each block of a histogram is called a bin The size or “width” of a bin refers to the range in each block. Changing bins can change stories. - Don’t be fooled. - Don’t allow bad bin widths to obscure your data. DO NOT assume that default bin widths are appropriate.

## Density plots serve a similar purpose as histograms, but smooth the distribution.

Like histograms (even more so), we can be fooled by bandwidth, take control of this

## Cumulative Frequency Distributions clearly communicate quantiles

## Shapes of Distributions

Histograms, density plots, and cumulative frequency plots can reveal the shapes of distributions. This is important for understanding data and choosing a statistical approach.

## Distribution Shapes: Histograms

Bell-shaped Bimodal Skewed Uniform

## Distribution Shapes: Density plots

## Distribution Shapes: Cumul. Freq. Distros.

## Two Categorical Variables: Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots

Two Categorical Variables: Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots

## Two Categorical Variables—Goals

Visualize the association between variables. Example: Is Breeding Dangerous for Birds

## Is Breeding Dangerous for Birds?

Oppliger et al. (1996) removed eggs from some, but not other, *Parus* *major* nests to encourage them to breed more. They later assayed the moms for malaria. Here are the data as a **contingency table**.

## Visualization: Grouped Bar Graph

## Visualization: Stacked Bar Graph

## Visualization: Mosaic Plot

## One categorical and one numerical variable: Multiple histograms and Strip charts

## Example: Edgar Anderson’s Iris Data Set

Multiple Histograms This dataset is in R stats package print(iris)

## Avoid Over-plotting

Over-plotting hides data by placing data points on top of each other.

## Good Alternative: Strip Chart

To show data, data points are jittered about the x-axis. Note: The position on the x within groups is not meaningful.

## Another Alternative: Violin Plot

The shape of the “violins” reflects the distribution of the data.

## Two numerical variables: Scatterplots

## Two Numerical Variables—Goals

Visualize the association. Visualize the joint distribution.

## Two Continuous: Scatterplots

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Scatterplot With Legend

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Scatterplot Directly Label

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Small Multiples

## Line Graphs Show Data Over Time

For temporal data, note all observations with a data point, and connect each point with a line. Points may be omitted for clarity if there are no gaps

## Color Code Maps to Show Spatial Data

Note: Maps need not refer to areas of land. For example, you can make a map of gene expression across the body.
