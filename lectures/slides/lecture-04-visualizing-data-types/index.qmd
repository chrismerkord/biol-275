## Consider Data Type

In presentation, “form follows data structure” One categorical variable: - Bar plots and Tables. One numerical variable: - Histograms, Density plots, and Cumulative Freq. Distros. Two categorical variables: - Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots. One numerical variable + one categorical variable: - Multiple histograms, Strip charts, and Box plots. Two numerical variables and beyond: - Scatterplots and Small multiples

## One Categorical Variable: Bar plots and Tables

One Categorical Variable: Bar plots and Tables

## Nonsensical ordering hides patterns

Order ordinal factors meaningfully. - For example, January to December. Order nominal factors by count. - If there is a grab bag category, place it after the lowest count. Example: Leading Causes of Death

## Ordering Factors Nonsensically

Before re-ordering factors, patterns are unclear.

## Ordering Factors Meaningfully

After re-ordering factors, patterns become clear.

## Tables Should Follow Similar Rules (1 of 2)

Nonsense order hides patterns Alphabetical order is usually a bad idea.

## Tables Should Follow Similar Rules (2 of 2)

Order to reveal patterns List ordinal factors in a meaningful order. List nominal factors from greatest to least, with “all others” last.

## One Numerical Variable: Histograms, Density plots, and Cumulative Freq. Distros

One Numerical Variable: Histograms, Density plots, and Cumulative Freq. Distros

## One Numerical Variable—Goals

Visualize the center (Mean) Visualize the width (Variation) Visualize the shape (Distribution)

## Example: Gettysburg Address

All of the words in the Gettysburg Address. Let’s see the number of times words of various lengths come up.

## Gettysburg Address: Summary Table

Number of words of a given length in the Gettysburg Address.

## Histograms visually describe summary tables

## Histograms—Consider Your Bins

Each block of a histogram is called a bin The size or “width” of a bin refers to the range in each block. Changing bins can change stories. - Don’t be fooled. - Don’t allow bad bin widths to obscure your data. DO NOT assume that default bin widths are appropriate.

## Density plots serve a similar purpose as histograms, but smooth the distribution.

Like histograms (even more so), we can be fooled by bandwidth, take control of this

## Cumulative Frequency Distributions clearly communicate quantiles

## Shapes of Distributions

Histograms, density plots, and cumulative frequency plots can reveal the shapes of distributions. This is important for understanding data and choosing a statistical approach.

## Distribution Shapes: Histograms

Bell-shaped Bimodal Skewed Uniform

## Distribution Shapes: Density plots

## Distribution Shapes: Cumul. Freq. Distros.

## Two Categorical Variables: Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots

Two Categorical Variables: Bar plots, Contingency Tables, and Mosaic Plots

## Two Categorical Variables—Goals

Visualize the association between variables. Example: Is Breeding Dangerous for Birds

## Is Breeding Dangerous for Birds?

Oppliger et al. (1996) removed eggs from some, but not other, *Parus* *major* nests to encourage them to breed more. They later assayed the moms for malaria. Here are the data as a **contingency table**.

## Visualization: Grouped Bar Graph

## Visualization: Stacked Bar Graph

## Visualization: Mosaic Plot

## One categorical and one numerical variable: Multiple histograms and Strip charts

## Example: Edgar Anderson’s Iris Data Set

Multiple Histograms This dataset is in R stats package print(iris)

## Avoid Over-plotting

Over-plotting hides data by placing data points on top of each other.

## Good Alternative: Strip Chart

To show data, data points are jittered about the x-axis. Note: The position on the x within groups is not meaningful.

## Another Alternative: Violin Plot

The shape of the “violins” reflects the distribution of the data.

## Two numerical variables: Scatterplots

## Two Numerical Variables—Goals

Visualize the association. Visualize the joint distribution.

## Two Continuous: Scatterplots

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Scatterplot With Legend

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Scatterplot Directly Label

## Two Continuous + One Categorical: Small Multiples

## Line Graphs Show Data Over Time

For temporal data, note all observations with a data point, and connect each point with a line. Points may be omitted for clarity if there are no gaps

## Color Code Maps to Show Spatial Data

Note: Maps need not refer to areas of land. For example, you can make a map of gene expression across the body.
