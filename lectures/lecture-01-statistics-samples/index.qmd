## Learning Objectives

1.  Understand the major goal of statistics

2.  Distinguish between a sample and a population

3.  Distinguish between an estimate and a parameter

4.  Identify why estimates from samples may deviate from parameters of populations

5.  Identify the properties of a good sample

## What’s the point of statistics?

-   **Goal:** We want to learn about the world.

-   **Challenge:** We can’t look at the whole world.

-   **Solution:** Take a sample and generalize outward.

-   **New Challenge:** Samples deviate from the populations by Bad luck (sampling error) or Unrepresentative sampling (sampling bias)

## Statistics’ fundamental obsession

**Question:**

How do we make inferences about the WORLD from our finite observations?

**Answer:**

Make models to account for the process of sampling and the associated hazards

## [Populations]{.keyword} and [samples]{.keyword}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   A [population]{.keyword} contains all the individuals units of interest

-   A [sample]{.keyword} is a subset of units taken from the population that we collect and analyze to learn about a population
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

:::
:::::

## [Sample Units]{.keyword} can be almost anything

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
Units are often individual organisms, but not always

Could be:

-   Groups of organisms (e.g. familes)

-   Similar parts on a single organisms (e.g. trichomes on a leaf)

-   Single parts across multiple organisms (e.g. beaks on birds)

-   Areas of land (e.g. vegetation quadrats)

-   Etc.

## Parameters versus Estimates (1 of 2)

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### [Parameters]{.keyword}

-   Describe **populations**
-   Only known if you measure entire population
-   Parameters are **fixed**
-   Parameters are **the world**
-   Parameters are **the truth**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### [Statistics]{.keyword}

-   **Estimates** of parameters
-   Inferred **from samples**
-   Are **random variables**
-   Change from one sample to the next
:::
:::::

## [Sampling Bias]{.keyword} and [Sampling Error]{.keyword}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
[Sampling bias]{.keyword}

Systematic difference between estimates and parameters

[Sampling error]{.keyword}

Undirected deviation of estimates away from parameters.

[Precision]{.keyword}

How close estimates are to each other
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![Colored points are estimates from a sample. The [**Red X**]{style="color: red;"} is the true parameter value.](images/clipboard-537756050.png)
:::
:::::

## [Sampling bias]{.keyword}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Systematic difference between a parameter and its estimate

-   Estimates from multiple samples tend to deviate from parameters in the same direction

-   Arises when samples aren’t representative

## [Volunteer Bias]{.keyword}

Volunteers for a study are likely to be different, on average, from the population.

Examples:

-   Volunteers for sex surveys are more likely to be open about sex.

-   Volunteers for medical studies may be sicker than the general population.

-   Animals that are caught may be slower or more docile than those that are not.

Taking random samples is hard and requires effort

## A random sample is a good sample

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
When units are chosen at random from a population, it is called a [random sample]{.keyword}

Random sampling minimizes bias and allows for estimation of sampling error

Rules:

-   Each unit should have an equal chance of being included in a sample

-   Selection of units must be independent

**All statistics we do assumes a random sample**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
[Convenience sample]{.keyword}: easy but biased; not random, not independent

## How to get a [random sample]{.keyword}

Carefully characterize a population and use computer code (e.g. the `sample()` function in R) to select participants randomly.

![](images/clipboard-333877456.png)

## Sampling Error

[Sampling Error]{.keyword}:

-   The difference between the estimate and its true parameter value.

Even if you sample perfectly, by the book, your estimates will differ from the true parameter by chance.

## Estimates are random variables

Because an estimate is a random variable, the value of an estimate is influenced by chance

## **Sampling error declines with sample size**

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
-   Larger sample -\> smaller sampling error
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
