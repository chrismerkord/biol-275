## What is Dryad?

[Dryad](https://datadryad.org/) is a public, curated data repository where researchers publish the datasets that support a scientific study. In many cases, journals (or funders) require authors to make data available, and Dryad is one common way they do that.

Dryad records typically include:

-   A dataset title and description (metadata)
-   One or more data files (often `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.xlsx`, or a `.zip` containing files)
-   A **DOI** (a permanent identifier) so the dataset can be cited
-   License terms describing how the data can be reused

## How Dryad relates to journal articles

A Dryad dataset is usually connected to a specific peer-reviewed journal article.

-   The **journal article** explains the scientific background, methods, and interpretation.
-   The **Dryad dataset** provides the underlying files that were analyzed in that article.

You should assume that you will need both:

-   Use the **Dryad page** to download the data.
-   Use the **journal article** (or at least the methods + data descriptions) to understand what the variables mean, how sampling was done, and what each row represents.

In practice:

-   If you find an interesting article first, look for a “Data Availability” statement and follow the link to the dataset.
-   If you find an interesting dataset first, look for the “Related publication” on the Dryad page and skim the article.

## Why Dryad is a good source for the EDA project

Dryad can be a strong fit for the EDA project because many datasets are:

-   Real research data (not toy examples)
-   Rich enough for multiple plots and questions
-   Licensed for reuse
-   Documented (sometimes very well, sometimes not)

However, quality varies a lot. Your job is to find a dataset that is usable within the time constraints of the course.

## Tips for searching Dryad effectively

### Start with topics, not with species names

Search terms that often work well:

-   Study system or field: `grassland`, `wetland`, `forest`, `urban`, `stream`
-   Methods: `camera trap`, `point count`, `mark recapture`, `telemetry`, `eDNA`
-   Data structure: `time series`, `trait`, `occurrence`, `survey`, `monitoring`
-   Environmental drivers: `temperature`, `precipitation`, `nutrients`, `land cover`

Species names can work, but topic/method searches tend to surface datasets with clearer analytical structure.

### Use Dryad filters and metadata fields

On Dryad, use filters (when available) to narrow results by:

-   Year
-   Subject area
-   File type / number of files (sometimes a proxy for “substantial dataset”)

When you open a Dryad record, pay attention to:

-   The dataset description (is it specific and informative?)
-   The file list (are they in usable formats?)
-   The related publication link (does it clearly explain the data?)

### Prefer datasets that look “analysis-ready”

Good signs:

-   Data files are `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.xlsx`
-   There is a README or “data dictionary” file explaining variables
-   Variable names are interpretable (not just `V1`, `X3`, `temp2`)
-   The dataset is “tidy-ish” (rows are observations; columns are variables), or at least can be made tidy without heroic effort
-   Sample size is large enough to visualize patterns (often at least dozens of rows; ideally hundreds+)

## Things to watch out for

### 1) “Data” that are not really data

Some Dryad records are not suitable for this course because the files are:

-   PDFs of tables
-   Specialized formats meant for a niche tool or workflow
-   Only model outputs (no primary observations)
-   Too small or too aggregated (e.g., one summary row per group, with no raw observations)

### 2) Unclear observational units

Before committing to a dataset, you should be able to answer:

-   What does **one row** represent?
-   What is the **sampling unit** (individual, site, plot, transect, day, etc.)?
-   Are there repeated measures (same site measured over time)?
-   Are there multiple files representing different tables that must be joined?

If you cannot quickly determine what a row means, you will struggle to interpret your plots.

### 3) Messy structure is normal, but don’t choose a disaster

Some cleaning is expected. What you should avoid:

-   Dozens of separate files that require complex merging
-   No documentation and cryptic variable names
-   Data stored in wide formats with hundreds of columns *and* no clear ID variables
-   Everything embedded in “supplementary material” PDFs

A manageable dataset is one where you can import it, identify a few key variables, and start plotting within one lab period.

### 4) Licensing and attribution

Dryad datasets have a license (often CC0 or similar). Even when reuse is permitted:

-   You must cite the dataset DOI.
-   You should cite the related publication if you rely on its methods/data description.
-   You should not present results as if you collected the data yourself.

## A recommended workflow for choosing a Dryad dataset

1.  Search Dryad for a topic/method you care about.

2.  Open a promising dataset record.

3.  Check file formats and documentation.

4.  Identify:

    -   the unit of observation (row meaning)
    -   a small set of candidate variables (one response-like variable + a few predictors/grouping variables)

5.  Download and preview the data (even in Excel is fine for a first look).

6.  Decide whether it is realistic for the EDA project.

If you want feedback early, bring a link (Dryad URL/DOI) and a brief description of what you think the rows represent.

## Dataset catalog for the EDA project

This catalog is a curated list of Dryad datasets that the instructor (and sometimes past students) have already reviewed and found to be **good candidates** for the EDA project.

Use it when you want a faster path to a workable dataset, or when you want examples of what “good” looks like.

### Data dictionary: Dryad dataset catalog

The table below lists and describes the variables used in the **Dryad dataset catalog**. These variables describe *datasets*, not individual observations within a Dryad dataset.

Each row in the catalog corresponds to **one Dryad dataset (and its associated publication)**.
