## Overview

Today you will form your **EDA Project Team**, set up your shared **Posit Cloud** project, and submit your team information in **D2L**.

You are **not** expected to have a finalized dataset, research question, or project plan yet. This step is about getting your team organized and ensuring everyone has access to the shared workspace.

## Step 1. Join your D2L team first

Before you do anything in Posit Cloud, join a team in D2L so you know your official team number (EDA Project Team 1, EDA Project Team 2, etc.).

In D2L:

-   Go to Other Tools \> Groups.

-   Find and join a group named EDA Project Team 1, EDA Project Team 2, etc.

-   All members must join the same team number.

Your official team name will be your D2L group name (e.g., **EDA Project Team 6**). Use this exact team number everywhere.

## Step 2. Submit your team information in D2L (one submission per team)

Only one person per team submits this, and only after all members have joined the correct D2L team.

Submissions made before all team members are enrolled in the same D2L group will not be graded.

On your submission, include the following:

-   Project Name (1-4 words)

-   Names of group members (first and last), and the **email address they use to sign in to Posit Cloud**

-   One-sentence topic description that includes:

    -   a general domain (e.g., public health, ecology, behavior, epidemiology)

    -   a type of data (e.g., time series, counts, measurements, spatial data)

    -   Some examples: 

    ```         
    -   *We plan to explore a public health dataset that includes time series data and case counts.*

    -   *We are looking for an animal behavior dataset in Dryad that includes individual level experiment data.*
    ```

-   Submit the D2L assignment and inform the instructor so you can be added to the correct Posit Cloud workspace.

## Step 3. Get added to your Team-specific Posit Cloud workspace.

-   Tell the instructor you have submitted your D2L assignment.

-   The instructor will use the email addresses included on the submission to add each student to a Posit Cloud workspace for your team.

-   Refresh your browser to confirm you can see the new workspace.

## Create your Posit Cloud project

After everyone has been added to your Team-specific Posit Cloud Workspace:

-   **One person** creates a new Posit Cloud project for the team. This will be the project owner.

-   The project must be created in the **course workspace** (not your personal workspace).

-   Name the project using your 2-4 word team name, e.g. "Fish Migration Project".

-   The project owner must add all other team members as collaborators to that project.

    -   Open the project.

    -   Click the Gear icon.

At this stage, you are allowed to upload data or create R scripts as you work define your project dataset, research questions, and analyses.

## Step 4. Create a README.md in your Posit project (required)

In your Posit project, create a file named:

-   `README.md`

Copy/paste the template below into that file and fill it in.

For a simpler

### README.md template

``` markdown
# EDA Project Team Information

## Team

- D2L team number: EDA Project Team ____
- Team name (1–2 words): ______________________

## Members

- First Last (first.last@go.mnstate.edu)
- First Last (first.last@go.mnstate.edu)
- First Last (first.last@go.mnstate.edu)

## Posit Cloud project link
- Paste link here: 

## Preliminary topic (one sentence)
Write one sentence that includes:

- a **general domain** (e.g., public health, ecology, behavior, epidemiology)
- a **type of data** (e.g., time series, counts, measurements, spatial data)

Sentence:



## Notes
- All members verified collaborator access on: ____ / ____ / 2026
```

## Completion checklist

You are done when all of the following are true:

-   Everyone has joined the same **EDA Project Team \#** in D2L

-   One team member submitted the required information in D2L

-   You are a member of your project-specific Posit Cloud workspace.

-   Your Posit Cloud project exists, named correctly

-   All team members were added as moderators and **verified access**

-   `README.md` exists in the Posit project and is completed
