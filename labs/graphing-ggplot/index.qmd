## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

-   Describe the basic idea of building graphs in layers using ggplot2.
-   Create a ggplot object by specifying a dataset and aesthetic mappings.
-   Map numerical variables to the x- and y-axes to produce a scatterplot.
-   Map a categorical variable to color to represent groups in the data.
-   Use `facet_wrap()` to create small-multiple scatterplots.
-   Recreate a scatterplot with aesthetics and facets using a new dataset.
